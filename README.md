This is a LSTM programm for time series dataset.
The details of main parameters as follow.
  
input_size : numbers of input features  
num_layers : numbers of LSTM layers  
output_size : numbers of output features  
input_seq_length : numbers of steps to input  
output_seq_length : numbers of steps to output  
num_epochs : numbers of epochs to learn  
  
This program is wrote for comparison to SCINet(https://github.com/cure-lab/SCINet).
